Wordament
=========

Fun little program to cheat at Microsoft's Wordament: (http://www.xbox.com/en-us/marketplace/product/wordament)

The program parsed a 4x4 grid of letters and spits out all the possible words that can be formed by swiping connected tiles. 
To run the program you can use the given jar file to run the program in a terminal window with the command:


java -jar Wordament.jar


The code to have the computer read the board/click for you is implemented, but commented out since it can be unstable.
